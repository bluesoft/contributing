# How to contribute

## Things we will merge

* Bugfixes
* Performance improvements
* Features and components which are likely to be useful to the majority of Sapphire users

## Things we won't merge

* Code which introduces considerable performance degrations
* Features which are not important for most people (we want to keep the Sapphire small and tidy)
* Code which comes without tests
* Code which breaks existing tests

## Commits

* Commits message must follow the convention [commit-message-convention](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog/blob/master/CONVENTIONS.md)

## Workflow

* Fork the Sapphire repository
* Create a new branch in your fork (feature branch)
* If it makes sense, add tests for your code
* Make sure all tests pass
* Create a pull request
* In the description, ping one of [bluesofters](https://github.com/orgs/bluesoft/people)
